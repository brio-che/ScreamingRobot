# ScreamingRobot
A controllable robot that screams when it gets within close proximity or bumps into stuff.
Note 1: this uses a distance sensor and some kind of pc so if you don't have those two you should probably consider getting those
Note 2: I recommend having some form of knowledge or experience of building stuff with those funny little raspberry pis or arduinos
Note 3: you'll also have to slightly edit it to make sure it plays the right file.
