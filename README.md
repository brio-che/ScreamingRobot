# ScreamingRobot
A controllable robot that screams when it gets within close proximity or bumps into stuff.

Edits:

I was an idiot and thought this would be arduino compatible when I was like, 14. No, it is not.
You'll need a raspberry pi 3.5 running Thonny, pygame was used for audio files and the distance sensor was directly connected to the raspberry pi itself.
Here is a video if it in action: https://youtu.be/r_X1jvUoDjA
